# ChimeraTV
- 
ChimeraTV is an interactive promotion system specifically for casinos and pull tab establishments. It reduces the cost and time to print or modify conventional displays by replacing them with engaging and interactive scenes. You can choose from our growing catalog of promotions or request a new one and display it on any modern TV. Our online control panel allows you to update the scenes with no experience and minimal training.

Our platform eliminates the cost and waiting time compared to printing. Content can be updated any time, and almost immediately.It’s impressive. Digital signage attracts attention and it’s a great way to attract players. Players are more likely to pay attention if you are displaying promotions with animations versus print material which doesn’t change for usually over a month.ChimeraTV is a great way to help out your marketing team as it allows you to effectively and efficiently communicate messages with your customers and your employees. Using the latest software design practices and deep understanding of equipment allows TPS to offer displays at a highly competative price. Equipment and service costs are low and may even run on existing equipment, eliminating the need for additional purchases.
